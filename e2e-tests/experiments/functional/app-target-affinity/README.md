## About this experiment

This experiment verifies the storage volume by connecting to the Volume Target Pod. Target Pod Affinity policy can be used to co-locate volume target pod on the same node as workload.

Configured Policy having target-affinity label for example, using kubernetes.io/hostname as a topologyKey in CStorVolumePolicy
for e.g.
```
apiVersion: cstor.openebs.io/v1
kind: CStorVolumePolicy
metadata:
  name: csi-volume-policy
  namespace: openebs
spec:
  target:
    affinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: openebs.io/target-affinity
            operator: In
            values:
            - app-label                              // application-unique-label
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
        namespaces: ["default"]                      // application namespace
```

## Supported platforms:

K8s : 1.18+

OS : Ubuntu, CentOS

## Entry-criteria

- K8s cluster should be in healthy state including desired worker nodes in ready state.
- CSPC and CVC operators, openebs-ndm, cstor-csi-node daemonsets and csi controler statefulsets should be in running state.
- storage class and the cstor volume policy with affinity labe should be created

## Exit-criteria

- Application should be deployed successfully. Application and the cstor target has to be scheduled on the same node. 

## Steps performed

- Create the cstor volume policy and storage class.
- Deploy the application using the storage cass that created.
- Verify the application pod cstor volume target pod created successfully.
- Check the applicatio pod and target pod scheduled on the same node. 
- Restart the application pod and target pod to verify it's scheduled on the same node.

## How to run

- This experiment accepts the parameters in form of kubernetes job environmental variables.
- For running this experiment of csi volume resize, clone openens/cstor-operators[https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators] repo and then first apply rbac and crds for e2e-framework.
```
kubectl apply -f cstor-operators/e2e-tests/hack/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f cstor-operators/e2e-tests/hack/crds.yaml
```
then update the needed test specific values in run_e2e_test.yml file and create the kubernetes job.
```
kubectl create -f run_e2e_test.yml
```
All the env variables description is provided with the comments in the same file.

After creating kubernetes job, when the jobâ€™s pod is instantiated, we can see the logs of that pod which is executing the test-case.

```
kubectl get pods -n e2e
kubectl logs -f <csi-app-target-affinity-xxxxx-xxxxx> -n e2e
```
To get the test-case result, get the corresponding e2e custom-resource `e2eresult` (short name: e2er ) and check its phase (Running or Completed) and result (Pass or Fail).

```
kubectl get e2er
kubectl get e2er csi-app-target-affinity -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.phase
kubectl get e2er csi-app-target-affinity -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.result
```
