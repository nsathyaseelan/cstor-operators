## About this experiment

 Test Case to validate the cspc pool creation is failed when the blockdevice has filesystem already on it.

## Supported platforms:

K8s : 1.18+

OS : Ubuntu

## Entry-criteria

- K8s cluster should be in healthy state including desired worker nodes in ready state.
- CSPC and CVC operators, openebs-ndm, cstor-csi-node daemonsets and csi controler statefulsets should be in running state.
- Application should be running successfully using cstor csi engine

## Exit-criteria

- CSPC pool creation has to be blocked by the admission webhook server.

## Steps performed

- Select the random node from the list of nodes.
- Obtain the unclaimed bockdevice from the selected node and get the device name (for ex /dev/sdb)
- SSH to the node and create the file system on the disk.
- Use the blockdevice to create the pool.
- Admission server will block the pool creation with the error `block device has file system`.
- Remove the file system created on the disk. 

## How to run

- This experiment accepts the parameters in form of kubernetes job environmental variables.
- For running this experiment of csi volume resize, clone openens/cstor-operators[https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators] repo and then first apply rbac and crds for e2e-framework.
```
kubectl apply -f cstor-operators/e2e-tests/hack/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f cstor-operators/e2e-tests/hack/crds.yaml
```
then update the needed test specific values in run_e2e_test.yml file and create the kubernetes job.
```
kubectl create -f run_e2e_test.yml
```
All the env variables description is provided with the comments in the same file.

After creating kubernetes job, when the jobâ€™s pod is instantiated, we can see the logs of that pod which is executing the test-case.

```
kubectl get pods -n e2e
kubectl logs -f <block-pool-creation-with-claimed-bd-xxxxx-xxxxx> -n e2e
```
To get the test-case result, get the corresponding e2e custom-resource `e2eresult` (short name: e2er ) and check its phase (Running or Completed) and result (Pass or Fail).

```
kubectl get e2er
kubectl get e2er block-pool-creation-with-claimed-bd -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.phase
kubectl get e2er block-pool-creation-with-claimed-bd -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.result
```
